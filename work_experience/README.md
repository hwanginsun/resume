- I have developed an Algorithm that checks the Pixel status of the TV Panel in real time. <br>
- I implemented it directly without using image processing algorithms such as OpenCV. <br>
The reason for this is that it is difficult to know and debug when the library is down. <br> 
Implemented in order to ensure reliability and promptness in the line produced in real time <br>

## Experienced technology:

### real-time large image processing
- Since I have to operate in real time, have managed issues such as stability, accuracy, and speed.

### 

###

## strength:

### global
- I worked with various engineers around the world.
- I'm ability to accomplish tasks in the face of any constraint.
  (Harsh working conditions and hardware specifications)
   + companies : Apple, JDI, LG Display, LG Electronics
   + location : china, poland, korea
   
### interest
- Create value that can be helped by constant interest
