- I have developed an Algorithm that checks the Pixel status of the TV Panel in real time. <br>
- I implemented it directly without using image processing algorithms such as OpenCV. <br>
The reason for this is that it is difficult to know and debug when the library is down. <br> 
Implemented in order to ensure reliability in the line produced in real time <br>
<br>

## Experienced technology:

### real-time large image processing

- Since I have to operate in real time, have managed issues such as stability, accuracy, and speed.
